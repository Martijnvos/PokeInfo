# PokéInfo
An unofficial pokédex made with the PokéAPI and VueJs utilizing Firebase's realtime database as a backend.  
I decided to make this in Vue in order for me to learn a more advanced Javascript framework.  
This application shows you the stats, moves, encounter information and game indices of all the different pokémon.
